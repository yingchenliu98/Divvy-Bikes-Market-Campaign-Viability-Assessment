# Divvy-Bikes-Market-Campaign-Viability-Assessment

## Which to blame for digital divide in bikeshare? Economic frictions or networked mobility.
 
### Motivation
Bike share has emerged as an popular means for first-and last-mile urban transportation in many cities. In Chicago, the City’s Department of Transportation launched a bike-sharing system “Divvy” in 2013. Sharing economy, by its nature, is expected to provide people with more equal access to services and goods. Nonetheless, data shows that the majority beneficiaries of Divvy program are still socio-economically advantaged populations. Recognizing the new kind of social divide in the bike share, since July 7th, 2015, Divvy has initiated “Divvy for Everyone” campaign to alleviate economic barriers for low-income population. Nonetheless, we would like to argue it is the benefit of “aided mobility” that contributes to the adoption. 
Policy implication: subsidizing demand side or supply side? Providing economic incentives to consumers or subsidizing suppliers to build more stations and enhance networked mobility?

This research aims to (1) confirm the hypothesis that economic friction is not the primary issue by identifying differential effects of the economic program on the usages across different areas given similar income level; (2) construct measures of  network characteristics/effects of stations (origins/destinations) and show its significance on the next period utilization; (3) propose a new model (maybe). We can expand the study to multiple cities and compare different adoption patterns in low-income neighbourhoods across cities.

The meaning of the research: On a higher level, we would like to understand why technology adoption lags behind in disadvantaged areas and how to improve the outcome. Evaluations of technology adoption include three dimensions: (1) utilization of technology itself; (2) the impact of technology on well-being such as health, employment, education, etc.; (3) misuse of technology. Our research focuses on the first dimension.
